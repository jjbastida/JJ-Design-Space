        <p>The cold night he brought in a pile of logs and a chipmunk jumped off as he lowered his arms. "What do you
            think you're doing in here?" he said, as it ran through the living room. It went through the library and
            stopped at the front door. This would be difficult for anyone to believe, except perhaps as the subject of a
            poem. One which has no drama in every sense of the word. Two people who grew up together, and spent a winter
            in the country. This, of course, is the barest outline.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their first week in the house was spent scraping, finding some of the house's secrets, like wallpaper under
            wallpaper. In the kitchen, a pattern of white-gold trellises supported purple grapes as big and round as
            ping-pong balls. While they painted the walls yellow, she could not help it but be mesmerized by the
            patterns underneath.
            <em class='fog'>
                I thought of the bits of grape that remained underneath and imagined the vine popping though, the way
                some plants can tenaciously push through anything.
            </em>
            The patterns drew him in close; the
            sunlight shining into the kitchen, reflecting off of his face as he thought about what he had left
            behind.
            <em class='fog'>
                I lost myself looking into what seemed like a white void. Those violet orbs, I looked into them, not
                wanting to look back, behind me, to see her sitting there, her eyes, blissfully wandering.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The day of the big snow, when he had to shovel and couldn’t find his cap and asked her how to wind a towel
            so that it would stay on his head.
            <em class='fog'>
                In the white towel turban, like a crazy king of snow. I heard it as our friends arrived that day.
                People liked the idea of our being
                together, leaving the city for the country. We were inspiring, we could have it all together, and we
                did.
            </em>
            That day many friends visited, sitting beside
            the fireplace they would tell their stories. About the child who happened to be standing on the right corner
            when the door of the ice cream truck came open and hundreds of popsicles crashed out. The man standing on
            the beach, sand sparkling in the sun, one bit glinting more than the rest, stooping to find a diamond ring.
            <em class='fog'>
                They told their stories to each other,
                laughing, enjoying, and sharing a hostile smile to the foreigner, me. They wanted us to be a miracle,
                they wanted me to be with you, when it was me all along, hoping to be rescued, all in silence.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The night out on the lawn, knee-deep in snow, chins pointed at the sky as the wind whirled down all the
            whiteness.<em class='fog'> It flurried down on us both. The white flecks of snow, gracefully
                descending and burying us in a
                thick silence. I would look over at you but could not see through the snow. You looked away, as I saw a
                I saw your enchanting smile, our love flurrying down and enveloping me in a white euphoria. I didn't
                need to hear it to believe it. </em>
            It seemed that the world had been turned upside down, and they were looking through an enormous field of
            Queen Anne's lace in full bloom.
            <em class='fog'>
                The cold settled in stages, that small curve of
                light was shaved from the moon, night after night, until I was no longer surprised, by the darkness in
                the
                sky. I couldn’t see you through the snow. I couldn't speak. I only saw myself in silence.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <q>Any life will seem dramatic if you omit mention of most of it.</q>
            Later, headlights off, their car was the first to ride through the newly fallen snow. The world outside the
            car looked solarized, sheer and white.

        </p>
        <p>
            She drove back to that house not long ago. It was April, and Allen had died. In spite of all the visitors,
            Allen, next door, had been her good friend in bad times. She sat with his wife in their living room, looking
            out the glass doors to the backyard, and there was Allen's pool. She could finally hear the rain as it
            poured down, pounding on the black plastic that had been stretched across for the winter. When she left that
            day, she drove past what had been their house. <em class='fog'>I counted the three or four crocuses that
                were blooming in the front - just a few dots of white, no field of snow. I felt embarrassed for them.
                They couldn't compete, they weren’t enough.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            He walked by that house not long after. It was June, as the sun, at its lowest point, was ascending. The
            haze that followed the night, fading as dawn began to rise. The smouldering heat rising through him as he
            stared from afar. His solo camping retreat had been great thus far. Getting away from the city and returning
            to the silence, wanting to heal what he couldn’t with her. He could see the clouds parting, the light
            casting his shadow and leaving an impression where they once laid. He focused his sights on their once home,
            deciding to stay a while. <em class='fog'>I counted the three crocuses that were struggling to stay alive.
                They couldn’t say what they needed, dried and shrivelled up. It felt shameful to see. They tried to seem
                fine, they couldn’t ask for help.</em>
        </p>
        <p>People forget years and remember moments. Seconds and symbols are left to sum things up: the black shroud
            over the pool, the shadow cast on the ground. Love, in its shortest form, becomes a word. A shared love,
            where neither of them could have said where the heart was. </p>
