        <hr>
        <p>
            A warm mist envelops me as it begins to rain ever so softly. I've been told it's good for me, it will help
            me grow and become who I am meant to be. I should enjoy the rain, and I try. It's not my first shower, in
            fact, but this weather appeared out of nowhere. The most natural it'd ever felt. But this rain is different.
            This soft drizzle; it's love. It embraces me, tells me that I'm perfect, but hates me all the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's still raining. I feel the streaks of rain rolling down my face, it's starting to become harder, more
            substantial. Harder to ignore, harder to stay alone. Every drop sends a shiver down my spine, I am at your
            mercy. I should love the rain, but its starting to hurt; has it always burned like acid? An almost numbing
            of my feelings, I can't breathe without you; what an intoxicating sensation. A euphoric climax of emotion, a
            whirlpool of your love. When it wanes, I wait for the pain; I want you more, I want you now.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want it to end, but it won't stop pouringâ€”the feeling of being drowned by my own tears. I feel this
            torrent, a flood, with no beginning and no end. Who have I become, where have I gone, and when will this
            downpour cease to be? I can't see anything, I'm too far below the surface to see my own light. Where did it
            all go wrong? I want to hate the rain, but is it even raining anymore? Was I really the victim of a typhoon,
            or was I the storm? My surroundings are all the same, they never changed. I'm enveloped in a wet nightmare
            from which I cannot wake. The rain always wanes. And when it does, when the sun does shine, nothing is left,
            but the remains of who we once were.
