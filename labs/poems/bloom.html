        <h2>Poem by JJ Bastida</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            An explosion of flames and lustre. In an instant, my burning passion burns brighter than any star. What was
            once a pile of ashes, now an insurmountable force which serves to propel me forward. My smouldering heart,
            glistening, shining, in a way that is unmatched and uniquely mine. The stars above me whisper sweet
            melodies, talking, observing, hoping that this time I'll join them up in that radiant sky. I know I can
            glisten as bright as any star, the most luminous supernova, but I never truly let myself be who I am.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm held back by what I fear, by that night sky, by the gaze of onlookers and what I think the stars might
            be saying. I know I'm not a star, but I want to be in that sky. I want them all to feel my warmth, my
            smouldering heart as it burns. The fire within, it's my driving force, it's all I've ever felt. As I climb
            closer to the sky, as I climb closer to who I wanted to be, I burst with passion, with beauty. I could not
            contain myself any longer, I am not a star. I am a flower of flames, my petals unfurling for you to see my
            true colours. A crimson light that illuminates the sky, blooming radiantly, and stretching farther than any
            light before it. I am more than just a star; I burn more beautifully than they could ever flourish. I don't
            need to glow in the same way they do. Even if for only a moment, I don't need to shine, because I burn. And
            unlike the stars, you can see every part of who I am, I am myself, and I am dazzling.
