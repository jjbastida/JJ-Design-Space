        <h2>Poem by JJ Bastida</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            A single leaf, carried away by the wind of change, makes no sound. My fluttering friend, traversing time and
            space, you know no bound. You watch and whisper, yet say nothing at all. Oh how far you've travelled;
            winter, spring, summer, and fall. Always but a whisper. You watch the years go by, the seasons change, the
            hours, the seconds. You were never in the sky. You are down on earth, my forest, our place.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I weep, it rains, and you watch. You don't think; you just are. When I smile, my lustrous light, you gaze
            into my heart. You watch my passions burn, until they burn out. And when my fears take hold, I know you'll
            be there. You always have been. But I sometimes forget you have no voice. Those soft winter winds become a
            torrential symphony, my essence swept up in the storm. I forget who I'm supposed to be and who I've been.
            But you don't. Your perfect in every way. And the storm always calms, leaving my fluttering little friend.
            I'm always by my side. And when I forget, I should simply remember, how a strong gale can create almost
            anything and leave nothing but the sound of a leaf in its wake.
