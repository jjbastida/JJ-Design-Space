        <h2>Poem by JJ Bastida</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            A warm melody in the forest; my sounds reverberate through the dense woods but cannot be felt by anyone. I
            of course hear it all, the swaying of trees, the downpour of rain, and the humming of bugs in the distance.
            The symphonic rhythms of these endless woods, who stretch infinitely with no name but remain mute to
            everyone. The moss blooms, petals sway in the wind, and not a soul hears my foreign lullaby. While in this
            forest I whisper to the stars, sing a melody to the wind, and scream out my love but hear not a single
            response.
        </p>
        <p>
            Farther, and deeper than anyone could ever hear, I whisper, sing, scream, but all I hear is my own
            desperation. An echo that reverberates deeper and harsher than anyone else's words. I can say to myself,
            yes, I am not heard. But how can I be when I don't even hum a word of how I feel. My own songs can become a
            whirring in my head, a remiss to the majesty of this unnamed hollow. Sometimes what I say is mute to the
            world, but that doesn't mean that I'm not meant to be heard. I am heard when my heart pours out, when I
            celebrate with myself, when I want to be there for you, when I hum a song of bliss, and when I want to cry
            in peace. I can always be heard by these woods with no name.
